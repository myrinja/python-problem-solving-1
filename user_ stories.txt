For example, given S = "abbaa", the obtained sequence of strings is:

abbaa -> bbaaa -> baaab -> aaabb -> aabba

Three of them have the same first and last letter.

Write a function:

function solution(S);

that, given a string S of length N, consisting of letters 'a' and/or 'b', returns the number of times the first letter is the same as the last in the obtained sequence of strings.

Examples:

    Given S = "abbaa", the function should return 3, as described above.

    Given S = "aaaa", the function should return 4. The first and last letters are always the same.

    Given S = "abab", the function should return 0. The first and last letters are always different.
